### 1. Multiple MVC

So far we have only worked with one ViewController at a time.  When we want to display information, we have only had one screen to work with.  This has served our needs for applications with a single purpose.  However, we often want to have multiple MVCs that are joined together.  

**Question: What are some examples of multiple MVC in apps?**


There are 3 main ways in which we can combine MVCs:

- TabBarController
- NavigationController
- SplitViewController (mainly for iPad)

SplitViewControllers are mainly useful for iPad and we will discuss those in later units.

### 2. TabBarController Introduction

A TabBarController is a simple way to combine multiple MVCs together.  It creates a bar at the bottom of the phone with buttons at the bottom that allow you to move from one View Controller to the other.  The state of each of those View Controllers is maintained.

**In Storyboard**

Create two View Controllers inside your Main.storyboard file.  Give one a label that reads "View Controller One" and a blue view.  Give the other a label that reads "View Controller Two" and a red view.

Go to the Object Library and select a Tab Bar Controller.  Drag it into your Interface Builder.  It will bring two View Controllers with it.  It's trying to be helpful, but we have our own View Controllers so delete the ones that the Tab Bar Controller brings.

We need to do two things to hook up our ViewControllers to each other

1. Control drag from the Tab Bar Controller to each ViewController and select "view controllers" under "Relationship Segue"
2. Move the Storyboard Entry point (the arrow) to the Tab Bar Controller

Build and run the app and observe how you can move from one View Controller to another.

### 3. Navigation Controller

Let's return to our Movie app and see how we can add more information.


#### 1. Adding a new `UIViewController` to Display a single `Movie`

#### Storyboard Changes **(Use iPhone 6s for your simulation)**
1. Drag in a `UIViewController` into `Main.storyboard` from the *Objects Library* in the *Utilities Pane* and place it next to the `MovieTableViewController`
  - <img src="./Images/added_new_view_controller.png" width="500" alt="Placing a new VC on storyboard">
2. Select the `MovieTableViewCell` prototype cell (make sure you have the actual `cell` selected and not one of its subviews) and `ctrl`-Drag to the new `UIViewController`
3. On the outlet menu that pops up, select "`Selection Segue > Show`"
  - <img src="./Images/choosing_selection_segue.png" width="400" alt="Choosing the connection outlet type for a segue">
  - Note: "Accessory Selection" is the action to perform when adding an "accessory view." An example of an accessory view is the `>` (called a "chevron") you see all the way to the right on a cell in the Mail or Messages app on an iPhone.
  - The "Selection" type of segue refers to the action to take when the cell itself is tapped/selected.
  - <img src="./Images/single_segue_to_vc.png" width="500" alt="Single connected segue to VC">
4. Select the segue object in storyboard (the -> arrow), and in the *Attribute Inspector*, set it's identifier to `MovieDetailViewSegue`
  - <img src="./Images/giving_segue_id.png" width="250" alt="Giving a Segue ID">
5. Drag in a `UIImageView` into the view controller, giving it the following attributes:
  - `8pt` margins at the top, left, and right
  - A height of `240pt`
  - _Before adding these constraints, make sure the checkmark box for "Constrain to margins" is selected_
  - Switch the image view's `Content Mode` to `Aspect Fit`
6. Drag in 4 `UILabel`s below the `UIImageView` in a vertical row
  - Label them (in order): `Genre`, `Location`, `Summary` and `Summary Text`
  - Set their fonts to `System - 17pt`, except for `Summary Text` which will be `System - Light - 14pt`
  - Set the number of lines for `Summary Text` to 0
7. Select **all** of the `UILabel`s at once, by holding down the Command (⌘) Key while clicking on them
  - Select *Pin* and set it to **8pt margins**, also making sure that the checkmark for "Constrain to margins" is selected
  - Set the `Vertical Content Hugging Priority` to 1000 for all labels except `Summary Text`. Instead, set the *Vertical Compression Resistance* of `Summary Text` to 1000
8. Your view controller should resemble:

<img src="./Images/movie_vc_ui_storyboard.png" width="400" alt="Setting up the Movie VC UI">

Being able to set constraints in this batching form is one of the nice advantages of using storyboards.

<details><summary>Q1: Can you explain the reason behind giving <code>genreLabel, locationLabel, summaryLabel</code> a vertical hugging priority of <code>1000(Required)</code>, but not <code>summaryFullTextLabel</code>?</summary>
<br>
<br>

<code>summaryFullTextLabel</code> had its <code>numberOfLines</code> property changed to 0, meaning that it can have unlimited lines of text. The other labels will only have one. So we know that the vertical space needed for the first three labels will always be constant -- meaning that we want the bounds of the label to hug the text as much as possible so as to prevent expanding vertically (not that it would in this case, since the numberOfLines for them is 1). This is in constract to the <code>summaryFullTextLabel</code>, which we want to expand as much as needed to accomodate multiple lines of text. So setting a low vertical hugging priority allows it to expand as much as it needs to vertically.

#### Storyboard linking
1. Add a new file named `MovieDetailViewController` that subclasses `UIViewController` and place it in the correct folder and Xcode group
2. In `Main.storyboard` change the custom class of the view controller we just added to be `MovieDetailViewController`
3. Create outlets for each of the labels and the imageView. Name them:
  - `moviePosterImageView`, `genreLabel`, `locationLabel`, `summaryLabel`, and `summaryFullTextLabel`
4. Additionally, give `MovieDetailViewController` an instance variable of type `Movie`
  - `var selectedMovie: Movie!`
  - This property will hold a reference to the `Movie` from the cell that was tapped.

Your code in `MovieDetailViewController` should look like this:

```swift
class MovieDetailViewController: UIViewController {
  @IBOutlet weak var moviePosterImageView: UIImageView!
  @IBOutlet weak var genreLabel: UILabel!
  @IBOutlet weak var locationLabel: UILabel!
  @IBOutlet weak var summaryFullTextLabel: UILabel!
  @IBOutlet weak var summaryLabel: UILabel!

  var selectedMovie: Movie!
  override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
    }

    override func didReceiveMemoryWarning() {
        super.didReceiveMemoryWarning()
        // Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.
    }
}
```

<details><summary>Q1: Why do we add the force unwrapped <code>!</code> to the <code>selectedMovie</code> property?</summary>
<br>
<br>
By adding the <code>!</code>, we're guaranteeing the Swift compiler that by the time this property is used, it will not be nil. If we didn't include <code>!</code>, we'd have to either give <code>selectedProperty</code> a default value or write an initializer that would give it a default value.
<br><br>
If you follow this pattern, you want to be absolutely sure that you give properties a value before using them, otherwise you will cause your app to crash!

#### Preparing for Segue
A `UINavigationController` is unique in that it manages a _navigation stack_, which is a hierarchy of view controllers that are essentially stacked on top of each other.

You can think of each view controller as being a card in a stack of cards.  When you **push** a view controller onto the stack, you're putting a new card on top of the _stack_ of cards. That top-most card is what is currently visible on screen. When you **pop** a view controller, you're taking a card off the top of the _stack_, and revealing the card/view controller just below it.

> Developer Note: It's important to know that all view controllers currently on the stack can be accessed through the navigation controller

The `prepare(for:sender:)` method is where we get things ready for displaying a new view controller that has been set up in storyboard.

As mentioned in the documentation for [`prepare(for:sender:)`](https://developer.apple.com/reference/appkit/nssegueperforming/1409583-performsegue), the `sender` parameter refers to the object that has requested the segue. In our case, the `sender` is expected to be a `MovieTableviewCell` (since that's the connection we made earlier in `ctrl`-dragging our prototype cell to the new `MovieDetailViewController`). But because the `sender` is defined as being of type `Any?`, we should do a check to confirm our assumptions. Moreover, we'll need the cell to determine which movie cell was tapped.

```swift
  // ~~~ MovieTableViewController ~~~
  override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {

    // 1. We need to check what our sender is. Afterall, there might be multiple segues set up...
    if let tappedMovieCell: MovieTableViewCell = sender as? MovieTableViewCell {

    }
  }
```

The `segue` object is an instance of [`UIStoryboardSegue`](https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uistoryboardsegue), which has an instance property of `indentifier` that refers to the identifier string we gave to the segue earlier in `Main.storyboard` (we used `MovieDetailViewSegue`). In order to make sure that we have the correct segue (a storyboard can have many segues), we need to check that the identifier matches one that we expect:

```swift
  // ~~~ MovieTableViewController ~~~
  override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {

    // 1. We need to check what our sender is. Afterall, there might be multiple segues set up...
    if let tappedMovieCell: MovieTableViewCell = sender as? MovieTableViewCell {

      // 2. check for the right storyboard segue
      if segue.identifier == "MovieDetailViewSegue" {

      }
    }
  }
```

Taking another look at the `UIStoryboardSegue` documentation, we see that there is a property called `destination: UIViewController` which references the view controller that will be pushed onto the navigation stack. We need to cast it as a `MovieDetailViewController` since we know that the segue we're getting ready for is going to push to one.


```swift
// ~~~ MovieTableViewController ~~~
override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {
    // 1. We need to check what our sender is. Afterall, there might be multiple segues set up...
    if let tappedMovieCell: MovieTableViewCell = sender as? MovieTableViewCell {
      // 2. check for the right storyboard segue
      if segue.identifier == "MovieDetailViewSegue" {

        // 3. Get the destination VC
        let movieDetailViewController: MovieDetailViewController = segue.destination as! MovieDetailViewController


      }
    }
  }
```

While generally you should avoid force unwrapping, because we're certain of both the `sender` being `MovieTableViewCell` and the storyboard `seguesegue.identifier` being `MovieDetailViewSegue` we can say with some certainty that the next piece to the puzzle, `segue.destination`, is going to be a `MovieDetailViewController`.

We now have the tapped cell (`sender`) and the instance of `MovieDetailViewController` (`segue.destination`), but how do we get the `Movie` object that corresponds to the cell we selected?

We already wrote a piece of code in `cellForRow` that arranged our `movieData` by genre, but that required having the current `indexPath`. Fortunately, we can get that index path using a function of `UITableview` called `indexPath(for:)`. Using that function, along with our code from `cellForRow` we have:

```swift
// ~~~ MovieTableViewController ~~~
override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {
  // 1. check sender for the cell that was tapped
  if let tappedMovieCell: MovieTableViewCell = sender as? MovieTableViewCell {

    // 2. check for the right storyboard segue
    if segue.identifier == "MovieDetailViewSegue" {

      // 3. get reference to the destination view controller
      let movieDetailViewController: MovieDetailViewController = segue.destination as! MovieDetailViewController

      // 4. Getting the movie at the tapped cell
      let cellIndexPath = tableView.indexPath(for: tappedMovieCell)!

      // 5. Copy most of this code from cellForRow
      var cellMovie: Movie!
      if cellIndexPath.section == 0 {
        let actionMovies = self.filterMovies(for: .action)
        cellMovie = actionMovies[cellIndexPath.row]
      }
      else if cellIndexPath.section == 1 {
        let animatedMovies = self.filterMovies(for: .animation)
        cellMovie = animatedMovies[cellIndexPath.row]
      }
      else {
        let dramaticMovies = self.filterMovies(for: .drama)
        cellMovie = dramaticMovies[cellIndexPath.row]
      }

      // 6. set the destination MovieDetailViewController's selectedMovie property
      movieDetailViewController.selectedMovie = cellMovie
    }
  }
}
```

Now that the destination `MovieDetailViewController` has its `Movie` object reference, let's populate the labels:

```swift
// ~~~ MovieTableViewController ~~~
override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {
  // 1. We need to check what our sender is. Afterall, there might be multiple segues set up...
  if let tappedMovieCell: MovieTableViewCell = sender as? MovieTableViewCell {
    // 2. check for the right storyboard segue
    if segue.identifier == "MovieDetailViewSegue" {

      // 3. Get the destination VC
      let movieDetailViewController: MovieDetailViewController = segue.destination as! MovieDetailViewController

      // 4. Getting the movie at the tapped cell
      let cellIndexPath = tableView.indexPath(for: tappedMovieCell)!

      // 5. Copy most of this code from cellForRow
      var cellMovie: Movie!
      if cellIndexPath.section == 0 {
        let actionMovies = self.filterMovies(for: .action)
        cellMovie = actionMovies[cellIndexPath.row]
      }
      else if cellIndexPath.section == 1 {
        let animatedMovies = self.filterMovies(for: .animation)
        cellMovie = animatedMovies[cellIndexPath.row]
      }
      else {
        let dramaticMovies = self.filterMovies(for: .drama)
        cellMovie = dramaticMovies[cellIndexPath.row]
      }

      // 6. set the destination MovieDetailViewController's selectedMovie property
      movieDetailViewController.selectedMovie = cellMovie

      // 7. Set the properties of the MovieDetailViewController
      movieDetailViewController.moviePosterImageView.image = UIImage(named: cellMovie.poster)
      movieDetailViewController.genreLabel.text = "Genre: " + cellMovie.genre.capitalized
      movieDetailViewController.locationLabel.text = "Locations: " + cellMovie.locations.joined(separator: ", ")
      movieDetailViewController.summaryFullTextLabel.text = cellMovie.summary
    }
  }
}
```

Go ahead and run the poject at this point to see if the data gets passed along properly...

`fatal error: unexpectedly found nil while unwrapping an Optional value`

> **Discuss & Debug**: Why do you think we are getting force unwrapping errors?

#### Updating `MovieDetailViewController` with a `Movie`

Let's move our code to update property values of `MovieDetailViewController` into a new function in `MovieDetailViewController`, and let's call it `updateViews(for:)`:

```swift
  // ~~~ MovieDetailViewController ~~~
  func updateViews(for movie: Movie) {
    self.moviePosterImageView.image = UIImage(named: movie.poster)!
    self.genreLabel.text = "Genre: " + movie.genre.capitalized
    self.locationLabel.text = "Locations: " + movie.locations.joined(separator: ", ")
    self.summaryFullTextLabel.text = movie.summary
  }
```

Now, let's call `updateViews(for:)` in `viewDidLoad`

```swift
  // ~~~ MovieDetailViewController ~~~
  override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    self.updateViews(for: selectedMovie)
  }
```

And lastly, comment out the `selectedMovie` propery setting in `MovieTableViewController` so that your `prepare(for:sender:)` looks like:

```swift
// ~~~ MovieTableViewController ~~~
override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {
    // 1. We need to check what our sender is. Afterall, there might be multiple segues set up...
    if let tappedMovieCell: MovieTableViewCell = sender as? MovieTableViewCell {
      // 2. check for the right storyboard segue
      if segue.identifier == "MovieDetailViewSegue" {

        // 3. Get the destination VC
        let movieDetailViewController: MovieDetailViewController = segue.destination as! MovieDetailViewController

        // 4. Getting the movie at the tapped cell
        let cellIndexPath = tableView.indexPath(for: tappedMovieCell)!

        // 5. Copy most of this code from cellForRow
        var cellMovie: Movie!
        if cellIndexPath.section == 0 {
          let actionMovies = self.filterMovies(for: .action)
          cellMovie = actionMovies[cellIndexPath.row]
        }
        else if cellIndexPath.section == 1 {
          let animatedMovies = self.filterMovies(for: .animation)
          cellMovie = animatedMovies[cellIndexPath.row]
        }
        else {
          let dramaticMovies = self.filterMovies(for: .drama)
          cellMovie = dramaticMovies[cellIndexPath.row]
        }

        // 6. set the destination MovieDetailViewController's selectedMovie property
        movieDetailViewController.selectedMovie = cellMovie

        // 7. Set the properties of the MovieDetailViewController
//        movieDetailViewController.moviePosterImageView.image = UIImage(named: cellMovie.poster)
//        movieDetailViewController.genreLabel.text = "Genre: " + cellMovie.genre.capitalized
//        movieDetailViewController.locationLabel.text = "Locations: " + cellMovie.locations.joined(separator: ", ")
//        movieDetailViewController.summaryFullTextLabel.text = cellMovie.summary
      }
    }
  }
```

And re-run the project now. For all of your `MovieTableViewCells` that you tap on, you should see something similar to:

<img src="./Images/movie_detail_view_controller_full.png" width="400" alt="Final Detail View Controller">

<br><br>
<details><summary>Q: So why were we getting force unwrapping errors before and not now?</summary>
<br><br>
In short: we can instantiate a new <code>MovieDetailViewController</code> in code to have a reference to it, but we're not guaranteed that its UI elements are actually non-nil until the view controller is actually loaded on screen. This means that we can't set property values on <code>IBOutlets</code> outside of the view controller's class if we created it in storyboard. This is why we needed to add another method to <code>MovieDetailViewController</code> to handle this update in <code>viewDidLoad</code>, the point at which we can guarantee that the entire view hierarchy is set up and available.
<br><br>
Tough question, but incredibly important to understand!
