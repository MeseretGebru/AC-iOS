# Whiteboarding - Part 2

In our [first lesson](https://github.com/C4Q/AC-iOS/blob/master/lessons/dsa/Whiteboarding/README.md), we reviewed the key steps in problem solving.  Today, we'll demo another problem, then we will split into pairs for another set of whiteboarding questions.


**Demo Problem:**


Merge two sorted lists.

# Problem sets for class

**Warm ups:**

1. Write a function that removes all duplicate values from an array
2. Write a function that determines if a word is a palindrome (the same backwards and forwards)


**Facebook interview questions** (from Glassdoor):


1. Given an unsorted array of numbers, like [1, 3, 5, 4, 2], write a function that takes an integer and returns true if there's any pair of numbers in that array that can be summed up to the input integer.
 

2. Given an array of numbers, reset the array to put all the non-zero numbers in front of all the zeros in the array, then return the count of non-zero numbers. e.g., for an input array of [3,0,2,0,0,1,0,4], youâ€™ll end up with a return value of 4 and an array of [3,2,1,4,0,0,0,0] 

3. Return the head node of the singly linked list with each pair of nodes swapped. If there is a last odd node leave it in place. Example: Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 Output: 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5


4. A telephone keypad has letters associated with each number  (e.g. 2 = abc, 3 = def). Given a passphrase of "fb1" (e.g. one that you might use to log into a bank account), come up with an algorithm that would assemble an array that contains all the different possible letter combinations that, when typed into a telephone dial pad, would be equivalent to the original passphrase. That is, "fb1" equals "321" numerically; matching equivalent combinations include: "da1", "db1", "dc1", "ea1", "eb1", "ec1", "fa1" and "fc1".
