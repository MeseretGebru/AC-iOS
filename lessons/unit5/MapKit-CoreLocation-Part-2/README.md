## MapKit-CoreLocation 

## [Mapkit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit)  
Use the MapKit framework to embed maps directly into your own windows and views. You can add annotations and overlays to the map to call out points of interest or user destinations. You can also provide text completion for users typing in the name of a point of interest.

If your app offers transit directions, you can make your directions available to Maps. You can also use Maps to supplement the directions that you provide in your app. For example, if your app only provides directions for subway travel, you can use Maps to provide walking directions to and from subway stations.

## [CoreLocation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation)   
Core Location provides services for determining a device’s geographic location, altitude, orientation, or position relative to a nearby iBeacon. The framework uses all available onboard hardware, including Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth, magnetometer, barometer, and cellular hardware to gather data.

The first time that your app requests authorization, its authorization status is indeterminate and the system prompts the user to grant or deny the request (as shown in Figure 1). The system records the user's response and does not display this panel upon subsequent requests.

## Objectives
* mapkit - core location review  
* use the Yelp API to get location data and populate on a map
* add / remove annotations from a map
* set the span and region of a map
* use and implement the user tracking button
* customize the detailview of a callout 
* get Apple Maps directions
* create simulated location .gpx files  
* implement mapview delegates to modify the map data 

## [MKMapView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/mkmapview)  
You use this class as-is to display map information and to manipulate the map contents from your application. You can center the map on a given coordinate, specify the size of the area you want to display, and annotate the map with custom information.When you initialize a map view, you specify the initial region for that map to display by setting the region property of the map. A region is defined by a center point and a horizontal and vertical distance, referred to as the span. The span defines how much of the map should be visible and is also how you set the zoom level. For example, specifying a large span results in the user seeing in a wide geographical area at a low zoom level, whereas specifying a small span results in a more narrow geographical area and a higher zoom level.

## [CLLocationManager](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager)  
You use instances of this class to configure, start, and stop the Core Location services. A location manager object supports the following location-related activities:
* Tracking large or small changes in the user’s current location with a configurable degree of accuracy.
* Reporting heading changes from the onboard compass. (iOS only)
* Monitoring distinct regions of interest and generating location events when the user enters or leaves those regions.
* Deferring the delivery of location updates while the app is in the background. (iOS only)
* Reporting the range to nearby beacons.

## [MKMapViewDelegate](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/mkmapviewdelegate)  
Because many map operations require the MKMapView class to load data asynchronously, the map view calls these methods to notify your application when specific operations complete. The map view also uses these methods to request annotation and overlay views and to manage interactions with those views.

## [CLLocationManagerDelegate](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanagerdelegate)  
The location manager calls the methods of this delegate to report location-related events to your app. Implement this protocol in an app-specific object and use the methods to update your app. For example, you might use the current location to update the user's position on a map or you might return search results relevant only to the user's current location.


## In Class demo
* Prerequistes - register for a Yelp API Key 
* Use the Yelp API ```businesses``` [endpoint](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_search) ```GET https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/search```  
* Get the user's permission to use their location  
* Use the user's location to search for places  
* Populate the map with annotations from results 
* Create a custom view for the callout 
* Tap on a callout shows image of place 
* Get directions from Apple Maps to a destination

**NB: If you haven't updated the info.plist to include the appropriate privacy key, the diaglog won't prompt and you will receive the following message in the console:** 
This app has attempted to access privacy-sensitive data without a usage description. The app's Info.plist must contain an NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription key with a string value explaining to the user how the app uses this data

**Add the required privacy key to the info.plist along with a messge to the user stating why location tracking is needed**
