### 0. Objectives

1. Become familiar with using `UserDefaults` to store data
2. Understand that `UserDefaults` is a light-weight, persistant storage option for small amounts of data that relate to how your app should be configured, based on the user's selection/choices.
3. Understand how the `Codable` protocol  allows for easy conversion between Swift objects and storeable `Data`

### Persistence

### 1. `UserDefaults`: Light-weight, simple persistant storage

The intended use of `UserDefaults` is in the name: you want to store a user's default preferences when using your app. For example, suppose your app offered a "night mode". A user might only want to use your app in "night mode" because it's easier for them to read. It wouldn't be a great experience for them, however, if they had to switch the app into "night mode" every time they opened the app. Instead, you store the user's preference for using "night mode" in `UserDefaults` and then every time your app launches you retrieve that stored information and update your app before it finishes launching.

#### Where does `Codable` come in?

`UserDefaults` is a really great option for storing simple data types -- in fact, it only can natively store Swift or Foundation types. This includes (these Foundation objects are bridged to their Swift equivalents):

```
- NSData
- NSString
- NSNumber
	- UInt
	- Int
	- Float
	- Double
	- Bool
- NSDate
- NSArray
- NSDictionary
```

The tricky part is if you want to store custom objects that you've defined in code.

### 2. Trying out `UserDefaults`

> Note: We're going to be writing this code inside of `didFinishLaunching` in the `AppDelegate.swift` file.

Let's take a look at a few basic examples of storing and retrieving data.

It all begins with the `standard` singleton:

```swift
let defaults = UserDefaults.standard
```

> Note: It's possible to define a separate `UserDefaults` by creating one with a new id, but unnecessary for our purposes.

From here, it's as simple as calling `set(_:forKey:)` function on `defaults` in order to store data:

```swift
	let defaults = UserDefaults.standard

	// store a string
	let string = "Hello, World"
	defaults.set(string, forKey: "stringKey")

	// store a number
	let number = 10
	defaults.set(number, forKey: "numbersKey")

	// store an array
	let arr = ["Hello", "World"]
	defaults.set(arr, forKey: "arrKey")

	// store a dict
	let dict = ["Hello" : "World"]
	defaults.set(dict, forKey: "dictKey")
```

Retrieving that data is only slightly more work since you need to account for optionals and types:

```swift
	// retrieve a string
	if let aString = defaults.value(forKey: "stringKey") as? String {
		print("String Retrieved: \(aString)")
	}

	// retrieve a number
	if let aNumber = defaults.value(forKey: "numbersKey") as? Int {
		print("Number Retrieved: \(aNumber)")
	}

	// retrieve an array
	if let aArr = defaults.value(forKey: "arrKey") as? [String] {
		print("Array Retrieved: \(aArr)")
	}

	// retrieve a dict
	if let aDict = defaults.value(forKey: "dictKey") as? [String:String] {
		print("Dictionary Retrieved: \(aDict)")
	}
```

![Retrieval of values](./Images/userdefaults_retrieval.png)

Let's try a few out now:

#### Practice

**Instructions:** For each of these data structures, you must store them to `UserDefaults` and ensure that you can retrieve and print their properties just as we did in the first set of sample code:

```swift
// 1.
let numbersArr = [2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10]

// 2.
let dates = [Date(), Date(), Date(), Date()]

// 3.
let largerDict = [
	"name" : "Louis",
	"cats_name" : "Miley",
	"location" : "Queens"
	]

// 4.
let mixedTypeDict: [String : Any] = [
	"name" : "Miley",
	"breed" : "American Shorthair",
	"age" : 5
	]

// 5.
let nestedArray = [
	[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
	[10, 20, 30, 40, 50],
	[11, 12, 13, 14]
	]

// 6.
let nestedDictionary = [
	"cat" : [
		"name" : "Miley"
		],

	"dog" : [
		"name" : "Spot"
		]
	]

// 7.
let nestedStructure = [
	"cats" : [
		[ 	"name" : "Miley",
			"age"  : 5 ],
		[	"name" : "Bale",
			"age" : 14]
		]
	]

// 8. ~~ Advanced ~~
let advancedStructure: [String : Any] = [
	"cats" : [
		[	"name" : "Miley",
			"age"  : 5 		],
		[	"name" : "Bale",
			"age" : 14		]	],

	"dogs" : [
		[	"breed" : "Basset Hound",
			"age"  : 7 	],
		[	"breed" : "Greyhound",
			"age" : 3	]	],

	"stats" : [
		"scale" : "miles",
		"distance_to_sun" : 92.96,
		"distance_to_moon" : 238900
	]
]
```

### 3. `PropertyListEncoder/Decoder`

Let's say we have an object called `ReadingPreference` that is suppose to track a user's preferences when reading in an app:

```swift
class ReadingPreference {
	var fontName: String
	var fontSize: Float
	var darkMode: Bool

	init(fontName: String, fontSize: Float, darkMode: Bool) {
		self.fontName = fontName
		self.fontSize = fontSize
		self.darkMode = darkMode
	}
}

let preferences = ReadingPreference(fontName: "Menlo", fontSize: 16.0, darkMode: true)
```

Ideally, we'd like to store this object in `UserDefaults` so that we can load this information every time the app launches. We know that `UserDefaults.set(_:forKey:)` accepts an object of type `Any` and `UserDefaults.object(forKey:)` returns `Any`, so why don't we try to store that info like so:

```swift
let defaults = UserDefaults.standard
defaults.set(preferences, forKey: "readingPreferencesKey")

// later to load it up:
let preference = defaults.object(forKey: "readingPreferencesKey") as! ReadingPreference
```

Go ahead and run this...

![Non-Swift Type UserDefaults Error](./Images/userdefaults_throws.png)

What happened exactly? Remember that `UserDefaults` has no problem storing native Swift data types listed earlier. What it *cannot* do is store custom objects that you've defined in code. If you try to do this, an exception is thrown and your app will crash. To get around this, we can (very) simply implement the `Codable` protocol:

```swift
// WHAT? all we do is add the Codable protocol keyword and nothing else??? 👍
class ReadingPreference: Codable {
	var fontName: String
	var fontSize: Float
	var darkMode: Bool

	init(fontName: String, fontSize: Float, darkMode: Bool) {
		self.fontName = fontName
		self.fontSize = fontSize
		self.darkMode = darkMode
	}
}
```

### 4.  `Codable`: Making Swift even Swifter

Many of you will be starting your journey of Swift data serialization with some incredibly powerful and easy-to-use tools. I, of course, am refering to the `Codable` protocol which was introduced in Swift 4 to save developers from the agony that is de/serializing `Data`.

#### Serialization: What is it?

Serialization, in development, refers to converting an object/struct/var into raw data, essentially 0's and 1's. Serialization is performed when you need to store language/code-specific objects into persistant storage. Then later, when you need to retrieve the object from memory you de-serialize it, meaning you convert it from its raw binary back into useable objects in code.

#### Serialization: Where does it happen?

All over. But one very common scenario is making `URLRequest`s. Remember how the completion handlers for our network requests looked like:

```swift
func makeRequest(completion: @escaping (Data?)-> Void) {
// ... awesome code ...
}

```

They took a parameter of `Data?` because a response sent back from an API is all raw data! It's up to our code to **deserialize** it so that we can use it in our apps. Thats what `JSONSerialization` was being used for! It should be easy to see why that class was named the way it was: it's tasked with deserializing json-formatted `Data` into a Swift-useable type, `Any`.

Another place it is commonly used is to store/retrieve information from `UserDefaults`, which is what we're going to take a look at first.

---

The core component of the `Codable` protocol is that so long as the properties of an object that conforms to `Codable` are Swift types, you get a free `Dictionary` representation of your object.

> **Important:** `Codable` is a protocol that combines two other relavent protocols, `Encodable` and `Decodable`. Semantically, this means that an object which is "codable" should be both able to be "encoded" and "decoded." Remember that here, encoding/decoding are synonyms for serializing/deserializing

Now, there's still a little work that needs to be done in order to convert a `ReadingPreference` object into a data type that works with `UserDefaults`, but not terribly much work:

```swift
let preferences = ReadingPreference(fontName: "Menlo", fontSize: 16.0, darkMode: true)

// 1.
let encodedPreferences = try! PropertyListEncoder().encode(preferences)

// 2.
defaults.set(encodedPreferences, forKey: "encodedPreferences")

// 3.
let encoded = defaults.object(forKey: "encodedPreferences") as! Data

// 4.
let storedPrefs = try! PropertyListDecoder().decode(ReadingPreference.self, from: encoded)

print("\n\n\n\n\n\n\n")
print("Stored Preferences: \n\(storedPrefs.fontName), \(storedPrefs.fontSize), \(storedPrefs.darkMode)")
```

1. We make use of `PropertyListEncoder` which works with objects that conform to `Encodable` in order to create a `Data` object. `encode(_:)` can `throw` so we mark it with `try`
2.  `Data` is one of the Swift types that `UserDefaults` can store, so we call `set(_:forKey:)`
3. When we wish to retrieve the object, we call `object(forKey:)` which returns `Any?`. We know it is `Data` so we force cast it.
4. Lastly, we use `PropertyListDecoder.decode(_:from:)`. `decode(_:from:)` takes an object that is type of `Decodable.Protocol` in order to know what it should try to make the `Data` into. This also can `throw` so it is marked with a `try`

![Codable Working](./Images/codable_prefs.png)

Kinda amazing... there's a lot of powerful magic going on with this protocol. Someday, you should go and look up the source code for it.  But for now, let's just play around with some code examples.

---
### 5.  `Codable` Exercises

#### Ex 1. WarmUp: `LoggedInUser`

Now that we're storing a user's reading preferences successfully, let's also try storing some of their authentication information. Create a new class called `LoggedInUser`:

```swift
class LoggedInUser {
	var username: String
	var isPremium: Bool // if the user has a paid subscription
	var lastLogin: Date
}
```
**Task: Attempt to store and retrieve a new `LoggedInUser` from `UserDefaults`.**

#### Ex 2. In the Mix: `Cart`

Let's now imagine that our app offers some in-app purchases that we'd like to store in `UserDefaults` so that if the user adds some items to their cart but doesn't purchase them right away, it will still be there when they return to the app.

Let's begin with a `CartItem`, which will have a `name` for the product, a `sku` which will act as its unique identifier, and a `price` in dollars:

```swift
struct CartItem: Codable {
	let name: String
	let sku: Int
	let price: Double

	// Note: Adding the Codable protocol to this struct results in losing a struct's free initializer
	// This is because Codable comes with an initiaizer: init(decoder:)
	init(name: String, sku: Int, price: Double) {
		self.name = name
		self.sku = sku
		self.price = price
	}
}
```

`CartItems` should be managed by a `Cart` object:

```swift
class Cart {
	var items: [CartItem] = []

	init(items: [CartItem]) {
		self.items = items
	}

	// adds an items to the .items property
	func addItem(_ item: CartItem) {
	}

	// attempts remove an item, returns true if successful. false otherwise
	func removeItem(_ item: CartItem)  -> Bool {
	}
}
```

And lastly, saving and retrieving a cart should be done with a `CartStorageManager`

```swift
class CartStorageManager {
	let cart: Cart

	init(cart: Cart) {
		self.cart = cart
	}

	// Saves the cart to UserDefaults
	func saveCart() {
	}

	// Loads a Cart from UserDefaults if possible. If no cart is found stored in UserDefaults,
	// this returns an empty Cart
	class func loadCart() -> Cart {
	}
}
```

**You're tasked with the following:**

> Note: Rememeber to uncomment the tests to ensure your implementation works.

1. Ensure that the necessary classes conform to `Codable` protocol in order to be able to save a `Cart`.
	- Note: A `Cart` consists of itself and its `CartItem`s.
	- Note: Do all of the classes listed need to conform to `Codable`, or just some of them?
2. Create a few `CartItems` and add them to a `Cart`, test to make sure you're also able to remove them.
3. Add in the code for `saveCart` and `loadCart` in the `CartStorageManager`. The code should add the ability to save a `Cart` to `UserDefaults` and then later load it.
	- Be sure to test saving and loading! You should create a `Cart` with a few `CartItem`s in it, save the `Cart` to `UserDefaults` and then retrieve the `Cart`. After retrieving the `Cart`, make sure that it contains all of the items that were stored with it.
	- Note: Nested `Codable` items work totally fine with `UserDefaults`!
4. (Advanced) Have your `CartItem` and `Cart` objects conform to `Equatable`. Implement anyway you see fit, but take into account that `sku` property of `CartItem` is suppose to be unique. Be sure to update your code where needed to make use of your new protocol conformance.
